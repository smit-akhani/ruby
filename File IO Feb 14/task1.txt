Q. Why readlines was not printing \n?
A.
- In programming languages, such as C, Java, and Ruby, the newline character is represented
  as a '\n' which is an escape sequence.
- A newline is a character used to represent the end of a line of text and the beginning of a new line.
- So whenever ruby compiler encounters '\n', it moves the cursor to next line. However, if you
  specifically want to print '\n' to output screen then you would have to right like this '\\n'.
