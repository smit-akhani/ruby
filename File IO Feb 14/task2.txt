Q. ruby file_copy.rb < sometext.txt > everything.txt
   why above command first started writing from sometext.txt into file_copy.rb
   and not directly writing to everything.txt
A.
   In above command sometext.txt file is given as input to file_copy.rb (file_copy.rb < sometext.txt)
   and then file_copy.rb file processes it and writes output to everything.txt (file_copy.rb > everything.txt)
