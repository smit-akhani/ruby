Q. Which should we prefer strings and symbols ? and why ?
A. 
    String:
-> Strings is anything that is written between quotation marks,
   either "" or '';
-> Everytime you create a string in ruby, it occupies new memory space.
   e.g.
   "hello".object_id
   "hello".object_id
   output of above both will be different, even though content is same
-> String objects are mutable which means there values could be changed
   later on.

    Symbol:
-> A symbol is text that begins with a colon.
   e.g.
   :hello
   :abc
-> Symbols are immutable!
   The immutable nature of symbols makes them very valuable in programming
-> String objects are mutable which means there values could be changed
   later on.
-> Since symbols are immutable, they always refer to the same
   object and the same place in memory.


*   Which to prefer or use:
->  Strings can reduce a programâ€™s performance if string objects are repeatedly
    created and destroyed when the same object could have been reused in their
    place. For this reason, a program that uses symbols over strings
    (when possible) will run more efficiently and smoothly.
